# Titanic Survival Prediction Web Application

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a **Titanic Survival Prediction Web Application**. The application predicts the survival of Titanic passengers based on their personal details and circumstances, using a pre-trained machine learning (ML) model. The project was developed in an agile environment, adhering to Scrum practices, by a team of eight members.

## Key Features

- **Survival Prediction:** Predicts whether a Titanic passenger survived the disaster based on input data.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Implements a robust backend service for handling API requests.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Uses Docker Compose to seamlessly deploy and connect the ML model service and web app service.
- **Version Control:** Managed efficiently using GitLab, ensuring smooth collaboration and integration.
- **Agile Methodology:** Sprint planning, backlog management, and progress tracking were conducted using JIRA.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI
- **Containerization:** Docker Compose
- **Version Control:** GitLab
- **Project Management:** JIRA
- **Machine Learning:** Pre-trained ML model for survival prediction

## System Architecture

The project comprises two main services:

1. **Model Service:** Hosts the pre-trained ML model and exposes endpoints to handle prediction requests.
2. **Web App Service:** Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting passenger details and displaying predictions.

The services communicate via APIs, with Docker Compose ensuring seamless deployment and interconnection.
